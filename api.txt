I think its better to use Zomato API as it has better documentation and it is fairly easier to
learn and use as well as implement vs the Yelp API. The only issue with Zomato is that the API
is limited to 1000 server calls a day whereas the Yelp API has about 5000. But for the purposes
of this Assignment 1000 API calls per day is enough. In regards to putting it into production,
you can certainly contact Zomato for an increase in server calls for a certain price as even 5000
at the end of the day is not a lot.
